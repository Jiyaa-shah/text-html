                <I> Agriculture</I> is the practice of cultivating plants and livestock.[1] Agriculture was the key
                development in the rise
                of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that
                enabled people
                to live in cities. The history of agriculture began thousands of years ago. After gathering wild grains
                beginning
                at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers began to plant them around 11,500 years ago. Pigs, sheep,
                and cattle were
                domesticated over 10,000 years ago. Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the
                world.
                Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture in the twentieth century came to dominate
                agricultural output,
                though about 2 billion people still depended on subsistence agriculture. The major agricultural products
                can be broadly
                grouped into foods, fibers, fuels and raw materials (such as rubber). Food classes include cereals
                (grains), vegetables,
                fruits, oils, meat, milk, eggs and fungi. Over one-third of the world's workers are employed in
                agriculture, second only
                to the service sector, although in recent decades, the global trend of a decreasing number of
                agricultural workers continues,
                especially in developing countries where smallholding is being overtaken by industrial agriculture and
                mechanization that
                brings a enormous crop yield increase.
